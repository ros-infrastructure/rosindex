# Details of this folder

This folder contains the application lunr-index-build, customized for use with
rosindex. This folder is cloned from https://github.com/olivernn/lunr-index-builder.git,
then modified for use with rosindex. The original repository is unchanged since 2013,
so updates are not advised.

To update dependencies, cd to 'lunr-index-build' and run ```npm update --save=false``` 

The js/ version of lunr needs to match the version found in this folder, so update lunr there.
